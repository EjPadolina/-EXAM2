          Code enthusiast by day, pixel perfectionist by night. As a front-end
          developer, I transform caffeine-fueled ideas into interactive web
          wonders. From sleek UIs to bug-slaying heroics, I love making the web
          a better place—one component at a time. Let's collaborate and build
          something epic!
